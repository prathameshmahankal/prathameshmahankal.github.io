**RELEVANT PROJECTS**

**Image Retrieval Using Caption Generator** *(Microsoft Azure, Google
Cloud Platform, Keras, InceptionV3, GloVe)*

-   Built an image retrieval mechanism on top of a custom image caption
    generator model trained on the MS COCO 118k dataset.

-   Implemented transfer-learning using InceptionV3 model for image
    vectorization and pre-trained GloVe vector for word embedding.

-   Evaluated and compared the performance of different model
    architectures using the BLEU score as a metric.

**Text to Speech Using Tesseract OCR Engine** *(Deep Learning, Neural
Networks, Keras, Tensorflow, CNN, Tesseract OCR)*

-   Designed a system to capture an image, extracted all the text from
    it, and then converted this text file into a .wav file.

-   Developed a script to binarize the image and pass it through a
    Tesseract OCR system using the pytesseract module.

-   Incorporating additional features to recognize handwritten texts
    using Keras and Convolutional Neural Networks.

**Using Behavioral Science to Fight Climate Change** *(Clustering,
Random Forest, Bagging, SVM, Classification)*

-   Developed a web platform that analyzes county-wise environmental
    metrics and uses inference-based Machine Learning algorithms to
    detect the exact problem faced by that county and suggest tasks to
    individuals based on the problem.

-   Won the **Best Customer Validation** award among 100+ participants
    at the Techstars Startup Weekend Seattle hackathon.

**Customer Segmentation Analysis** *(kMeans, Trend Analysis,
Unsupervised Learning)*

-   Implemented behavioral analytics techniques to understand customer
    trends and determine what drives customer loyalty.

-   Segregated customers into segments using the Recency, Frequency,
    Monetary (RFM) segmentation model.

-   Proposed personalized marketing strategies to tackle complex
    technical challenges and improve user engagement and retention.
