I am currently pursuing my Masters in Information Management from the University of Washington at Seattle with Data Science as my specialization.

This summer, I worked at Hi-Rez Studios as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern, where I primarily worked on predicting customer churn and building a weekly recommender systems model. Iâ€™ve also been working at the IHME at UW as a Data Scientist, where I am building data cleaning and data pre-processing pipelines to enable researchers to model causes such as infertility and maternal health. I also optimized the data-streamlining processes in the team that reduced redundancy by 10% and subsequently increased computation speed by 30%. Before coming for my Masters, I've worked as a Data Analyst at Bank of America for two years. My work at BofA majorly involved collecting, cleaning and analyzing Equity trade data coming from all over Europe.

Apart from all this, I am a huge soccer fan, and have been in love with the sport for over a decade. In fact, I have been trying to implement my Data Science skills in the field of Soccer, which has helped me build a lot of projects related to Soccer Analytics.

I am currently looking for Data Science and Machine Learning Full-Time Opportunities.
